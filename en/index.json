We are excited you are here and want to contribute!\nThese guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved. If you have any questions that aren\u0026rsquo;t discussed below, please let us know by opening an issue!\nBefore you start you\u0026rsquo;ll need to set up a free GitHub account and sign in. You can sign up through this link and then interact with our repositories at https://github.com/OSUMontreal.\nAlready know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for in this guide? Jump to the following sections:\n Contributing to Open Science UMontreal  Don\u0026rsquo;t know where to get started? Joining the conversation Contributing small documentation changes Recommended workflow when contributing through GitHub  1. Open a new issue or comment on an existing one 2. Fork the docs.osumontreal.ca repository 3. Work on your branch and Test it 4. Check list 5. Submit and tag your pull request   Recognizing your contribution Thank you!    Don\u0026rsquo;t know where to get started? Read Joining the conversation and pop into our Matrix Chat to introduce yourself and tell us how you would like to contribute in the OSUM community! Let us know what your interests are and we will help you find an issue to contribute to. Thanks so much!\nJoining the conversation OSUM is a young communnity project maintained by a growing group of enthusiastic early-career researchers, mainly student. We\u0026rsquo;re excited to have you join! Most of our discussions will take place on open [issues][link_issues]. We also maintain a Matrix Chat for more informal conversations and general updates.\nThere is significant cross-talk between these two spaces, and we look forward to hearing from you in either venue! As a reminder, we expect all contributions to OSUM to adhere to our code of conduct.\nContributing small documentation changes If you are new to GitHub and just have a small documentation change recommendation, you can submit it to our e-mail address and one of our developers will add it to the documentation directly.\nRecommended workflow when contributing through GitHub Git is a really useful tool for version control. GitHub sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll use [Markdown][markdown] to discuss on GitHub. You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting. For example you can write words as bold (**bold**), or in italics (*italics*), or as a link ([link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)) to another webpage.\nGitHub has a helpful guide to get you started with writing and formatting Markdown.\nWe will be excited when you\u0026rsquo;ll suggest a new PR to fix improve In order to make this as fluid as possible we recommend to follow this workflow:\n1. Open a new issue or comment on an existing one Issues are individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forwards. Before starting to work on a new pull request we highly recommend you open an issue to explain what you want to do and how it echoes a specific demand from the community. If you have more an inquiry or suggestion to make than a bug to report, we encourage you to come and chat with us in the #dev:openscience room.\nA general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a great big issue that is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more. Moreover, it will be interesting to see how others approach your issue and give their opinion and maybe give you advice to find the best way to code it. Finally, it will prevent you to start working on something that is already in progress.\n2. Fork the docs.osumontreal.ca repository When you fork This way you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to work on your own instance of docs.osumontreal.ca. It will be a safe place where nothing can affect the main repository.\nOnce you have your own fork, you can clone it on you local computer by clicking the green Clone button to get your own URL:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/docs.osumontreal.ca.git cd docs.osumontreal.ca Make sure to always keep your fork up to date with the upstream repository before and after making changes. You can follow these command lines to help you.\nThe first time you try to sync your fork, you may have to set the upstream branch\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/osumontrea/docs.osumontreal.ca git remote -v # Verify the new upstream repo appears. git checkout main git fetch upstream main git merge upstream/main Then create a new branch for each issue. Using a new branch allows you to follow the standard GitHub workflow when making changes. This guide provides a useful overview for this workflow. Please keep the name of your branch short and self explanatory.\ngit checkout -b MYBRANCH 3. Work on your branch and Test it   To preview the website, you will need to install Hugo on your computer. Once installed, you can run the hugo server -D command and open http://localhost:1313/ in a browser.\n  Modify some content or code\n  Make sure Hugo can generate the whole website by building it with the hugo command.\n  4. Check list Pull Request Checklist (For Fastest Review):\n Check that all tests are passing (\u0026ldquo;All tests passsed\u0026rdquo;) Make sure you note any issues that will be closed by your PR Add a clear description of the purpose of you PR  5. Submit and tag your pull request When you submit a pull request we ask you to follow the tag specification. In order to simplify reviewers work, we ask you to use at least one of the following tags:\n [BRK] for changes which break existing builds or tests [DOC] for new or updated documentation [ENH] for enhancements [FIX] for bug fixes [TST] for new or updated tests [REF] for refactoring existing code [MAINT] for maintenance of code [WIP] for work in progress  You can also combine the tags above, for example if you are updating both a test and the documentation: [TST, DOC].\nRecognizing your contribution We welcome and recognize all kinds of contribution from reporting bugs, improving the documentation, testing our tools to code development.\nThank you! You\u0026rsquo;re amazing. :wave: :smiley:\n— Based on contributing guidelines from the tedana and STEMM Role Models projects.\n"},{"uri":"https://docs.osumontreal.ca/en/","title":"Home","tags":[],"description":"","content":"What is OSUM?\n"},{"uri":"https://docs.osumontreal.ca/en/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
