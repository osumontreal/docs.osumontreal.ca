## Find people and send direct messages

To create a 1:1 conversation with a person, you need to click on the :plus:
(`+`) sign in the _"People"_ section in the left sidebar. You can then search
someone by their (display) name, username, or email. You may have to wait a
little after typing the last character before the search results appear. Please
also note on which server your searched person is displayed.

In the search result, click on the target person and then click on **_Go_**. The
conversation window will opens. You can have a conversation once the other
person connects to the server and accepts the invitation.

By default, [end-to-end encryption is enable]({{% relref "encryption" %}}) as it
is the standard. The connection to the server is of course also
transport-encrypted. If you explicitly do not want end-to-end encryption for a
special reason, you can [create an unencrypted room]({{% relref "create" %}})
and invite people in.

A room with yourself is also possible, which can used as notebook / clipboard
and for tests like to check whether formatting and hyperlinks look correct.
