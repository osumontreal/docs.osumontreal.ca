# Further development of Matrix

We, [Open Science UMontreal](https://osumontreal.ca), does not pay for the
source code but we do pay for the server to host our Matrix instance and put a
lot of volunteer work into maintaining the server and the documentation.

Matrix is an open standard, which all the details of interoperable communication
using the matrix set of HTTP-APIs are freely published online. Matrix is also
open source, which means that the source code of the reference servers, clients
and services has been released to the public under the Apache v2 license to
encourage everyone to run their own servers and clients.

Since it is free software, improvement requests can be converted into direct
programming jobs. Currently still in development, and can be
promoted/accelerated by orders/donations.

We, the maintainers of this server, are in contact with the Matrix/Element
developers and try to occasionally contribute to the Matrix ecosystem by means
of testing, commenting, opening issues, etc. to help with the development of all
Matrix-related tools.

new things, we want to hear from you @ matrix@openscience.ca. {{% /notice %}}
