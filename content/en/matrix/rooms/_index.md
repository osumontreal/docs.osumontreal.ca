# Rooms

Matrix supports public and private conversations in what we call **rooms**.
One-to-one and group chat rooms are organized the same way, making it easy for
you to:

## - [find / leave rooms]({{< relref "find-leave" >}})

## - [create rooms and adjust settings]({{< relref "create" >}})

## - [delete rooms]({{< relref "delete" >}})

## - [share rooms]({{< relref "share" >}})

## Room vs People

But wait, I see a People section and a Room section... What is going on?

In the _People_ section, you see all the conversations you have with people
one-to-one rooms.

In the _Room_ section, you see all the public channels you have joined,
including group conversations you have been a part of. Private conversations
with many people are listed in this section as well since these rooms are simply
_private rooms_, unless you decide to make them public by changing its settings.
