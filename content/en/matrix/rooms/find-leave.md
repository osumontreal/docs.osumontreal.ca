## Find rooms

The room directory, in which the publicly accessible rooms are presented, can be
open via the :compass: (compass) button "Explore / Discover" in the left
sidebar, under your name or via the :plus: sign button next to the _Rooms_
section title. A new window will open and you will be able to search for public
Rooms on the Open Science server and others through the federation.

{{% notice note %}} The global federation is currently in test operation,
meaning you can join any room on servers that have enabled the global
federation. It is possible that the Federation will be restricted again at a
later date if problem arises. {{% /notice %}}

## Leave rooms

In the left sidebar, hover the room you want to leave and click on the `...`
(room options) button, then click on _Leave Room_.

Rooms that you leave no longer appear in your room list (left sidebar), but may
appear in a new section at the bottom called _Historical_. You can get rid of
them completely by clicking on the `...` again and click on _Forget Room_.
