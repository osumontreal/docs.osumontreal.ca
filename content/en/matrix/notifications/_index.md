Like any communication platforms, you have to be able to do your work and not be
disturbed. In times of digital distraction, we all need to learn how
notifications should be adapted step by step in a meaningful way.

**_Scenario 1:_**

> If you are writing a proposal for a research project and the deadline is
> approaching, you may want to be notified when your colleagues want to start a
> discussion with you. Notifications in this room are intended to draw attention
> and can be set accordingly.

**_Scenario 2:_**

> If you are in a room whose main purpose is to inform yourself about new
> scientific papers and other interesting things from time to time, you may want
> to turn off the notifications and remind yourself to enter the room from time
> to time, or you may want to be notified only when your name is mentioned in
> the discussion.

Fortunalety, Element allows you to customise your notifications at two levels:
across the app through Global Settings and per room.

### Global settings

T0 access the global notification panel from the web/desktop app, you need to:

1. Click on your name or your picture in the top left corner;
1. Click on _Notification settings_ in the drop down menu;

These default settings, as the name implies, are applied globally across the app
for particular events for group and one-to-one chat rooms, invites and calls.
For example, if you turn `Enable audible notifications for this session` off, no
sound ever will n0tify you. Most notification options can be turned _off_, _on_
or _noisy_. You can then choose which events should trigger a notification.

The notifications can be:

- **Turned off**: you won’t be notified when the selected event happens.
- **Turned on**: you will get a message popping up when the selected event
  happens, but no sound.
- **_Noisy_**: you will get a visual highlight (red badge and/or text
  highlight), a sound and/or vibration (depending on the device) when the
  selected event happens. There will be a sound only if the global _audible
  notification_ setting is set to on.

You can also configure keywords by clicking on it and enter as many keywords as
you want separated by a comma.

### Per room fine-tuning

You can also configure the notification settings for each room individually
based on your needs. This is very handy when you wish to temporarily mute a
room, or make sure you’re not missing anything from a given discussion.

1. Hover a chat or room in the room list on the left;
2. You should now see a bell appears - Click on it;
3. Select the option you want between _Use default_, _All messages_, _Mentions &
   Keywords_ or _None_.
   - **Use default**: Default settings from the Global notification settings
     apply. (That is the default option).
   - **All messages**: You get a notification for every message happening in the
     room.
   - **Mentions & Keywords**: You are only notified for the items that are meant
     to be ‘noisy’, namely your when someone @YOURUSERNAME and keywords
     previously set in the Global notification settings.
   - **None**: You won’t be notified, even if your name or a keyword is
     mentioned.
