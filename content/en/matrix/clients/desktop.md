After installing the Element Desktop client, you will have to register if you
have not registered yet. Otherwise, you can skip the registration process
section and read the [Sign in section below](#sign-in) to make sure to use your
existing account **on our server** and not create a new account on another
server like matrix.org.

### Registration process through the Element App

1. Open the Element Desktop App;
1. Click on the green _Create Account_ button;
1. Click on **Change** and enter the custom homeserver:
   `https://matrix.openscience.ca`
1. Fill in the form. Choose your username carefully since it is not possible to
   change it. We recommend using your `FirstLastname` but you are free to pick
   any username that complies with our Code of Conduct.
1. Click on the _Register_ button.
1. Voilà, you should now be signed in in the Matrix 🌐!

### Sign in

1. Click on the blue _Sign in_ button;
1. To not accidentally end up on the wrong server (matrix.org), click on
   **Change** and manually specify the home server:
   `https://matrix.openscience.ca`;
1. Click Next and enter your credentials. The default option is to enter your
   _Username_, but you can change the _Username_ option for the email address
   you signed up with via the drop-down menu "_Sign in with:_". We recommend
   leaving it to the default option, namely _Username_.
1. Enter your username and password
1. Click on _Sign In_
1. You are now signed in, congratulations! :tada:
1. By activating the slider under Settings > Settings > "**Automatic start after
   system login**", the Element client will start after every reboot and you
   will no longer miss any notifications due to accidentally closing the browser
   tab.

{{% notice tip %}} There are many useful, additional settings and
recommendations described in the [Settings]({{% relref "../settings" %}})
section that will make you life easier :smile: {{% /notice %}}
