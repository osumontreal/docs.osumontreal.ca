In order to use our Element Web client, you have to go
[https://chat.openscience.ca](https://chat.openscience.ca).

{{% notice info %}} The first time you use our service, you will have to
register by clicking on
"[Create Account](https://chat.openscience.ca/#/register)" on the chat homepage
[https://chat.openscience.ca](https://chat.openscience.ca) unless you have
already registered with another matrix server and know how to join our server
through the federation.

If you require help during the registration process, refer to the [First
steps]({{% ref "matrix/first-steps" %}}) section.

If you are registered, you can skip the registration process section and read
the [Sign in section below](#sign-in) to make sure to use your existing account
**on our server** and not create a new account on another server like
matrix.org.

   _Username_.

{{% notice warning %}} If you want to immediately start using another [Matrix

at chat.openscience.ca, it is important to change the home server from the
default matrix.org server to https://matrix.openscience.ca {{% /notice %}}
