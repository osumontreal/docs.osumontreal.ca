# Using the [Element](https://chat.openscience.ca) Web client

In order to use our Element Web client, you have to go
[https://chat.openscience.ca](https://chat.openscience.ca).

{{% notice info %}} The first time you use our service, you will have to
register by clicking on
"[Create Account](https://chat.openscience.ca/#/register)" on the chat homepage
[https://chat.openscience.ca](https://chat.openscience.ca) unless you have
already registered with another matrix server and know how to join our server
through the federation.

If you require help during the registration process, you can refer to the [First
steps]({{% ref "matrix/first-steps" %}}) section.

Analogous to e-mail addresses, this results in matrix addresses with the
following structure: `@USERNAME:openscience.ca`

## Sign in process

{{% notice warning %}} If you want to immediately start using another [Matrix
Client]({{< relref "../clients" >}}) instead of the Element Web client installed
at chat.openscience.ca, it is important to change the home server from the
default matrix.org server to https://matrix.openscience.ca {{% /notice %}}
